# ECON 285 Final Project
## Phase 1: SD vs. SD with random bands
Test SD with random bands of size (SD) 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40 (RSD) and randomize order within each band.
Note that band size 1 is SD and 40 is RSD. We want to find a band size that balances efficiency, equity, and seniority ordering.

## Phase 2: SD vs. A-CEEI with seniority-weighted budgets
Test A-CEEI with seniority-perturbed budgets according to $$1 + \beta$$ where we vary $$\beta$$. It would be interesting to observe how $$\beta$$ affects the equity and fairness of the A-CEEI solution - I expect that high values should lead to A-CEEI collapsing to RSD.
