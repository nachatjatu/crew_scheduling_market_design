# ECON 285 Final Project

This project studies mechanisms for allocating airline “lines” (monthly schedules) under strict seniority constraints. The baseline mechanism is **Serial Dictatorship (SD)**, which mirrors real-world line bidding: crew pick lines in strict seniority order.

We evaluate two major extensions:
1. **SD with random seniority bands** (a union-compatible softening of strict seniority)  
2. **A-CEEI with seniority-weighted budgets** (a fairness-oriented competitive equilibrium mechanism)

The goal is to understand the **fairness–efficiency–seniority tradeoffs** generated by each mechanism family.

## Phase 1: Serial Dictatorship vs. SD with Random Seniority Bands

We evaluate SD alongside SD variants that introduce randomness **within seniority bands** while preserving strict seniority **across bands**.

### Mechanism
For a chosen band size $B$:

- Partition the 40 crew by seniority into bands of size $B$  
- Randomize the order **within each band**  
- Run Serial Dictatorship in this randomized-within-band order  
- Repeat multiple trials per band size to average out randomness

### Band Sizes Tested
$$
B \in \{1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40\}
$$

Special cases:
- **$B = 1$** → Pure Serial Dictatorship (strict seniority)  
- **$B = 40$** → Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD)

### Goal
Identify a band size that best balances:

- **Efficiency:** total welfare / average utility  
- **Equity:** Gini coefficient, envy, utility inequality  
- **Seniority-respecting-ness:**  
  - across-band: monotonic (always preserved)  
  - within-band: measure rate of seniority inversions  

The hypothesis is that **moderate band sizes (4–10)** will achieve large fairness gains with relatively small efficiency losses.

## Phase 2: Serial Dictatorship vs. A-CEEI with Seniority-Weighted Budgets

We compare SD to **Approximate Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes (A-CEEI)** with budgets that incorporate seniority.

### Mechanism
Each crew member receives a budget:
$$
b_i = 1 + \beta \cdot (n - \text{rank}(i))
$$

where:

- `rank(i)` = seniority rank (1 = most senior, 40 = least senior)  
- $\beta$ controls how strongly seniority affects purchasing power  
- higher budgets allow senior crew to afford higher-priced (more desirable) lines

A-CEEI computes:
- equilibrium-like prices  
- an approximately envy-free (EF1) and approximately efficient allocation  
- where higher budgets encode seniority within the competitive equilibrium

### β Values Tested
$$
\beta \in \{0,\ 0.1,\ 0.3,\ 0.5,\ 1.0\}
$$

Special cases:
- **$\beta = 0$** → equal budgets → fairness-first CE  
- **$\beta \approx 1$** → strong seniority influence  
- As $\beta$ increases, A-CEEI approaches SD (seniority dominates prices)

### Goal
Observe how budget slope $\beta$ affects:

- **Fairness:** envy, EF1 violations  
- **Efficiency:** total welfare  
- **Seniority alignment:** correlation between seniority and assigned utility  

We expect a “balanced” regime for $\beta \in [0.1, 0.5]$ where A-CEEI preserves seniority **in expectation** while improving equity substantially compared to SD.

If needed, we can later add:

- a "Metrics" section  
- minimal pseudocode for each mechanism  
- a structure for a `results/` folder  
- or a polished project overview for the repo’s README.
